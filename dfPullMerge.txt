Git Pull: git pull <remote>

The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content. 
Merging remote upstream changes into your local repository is a common task in Git-based collaboration work flows. 
The git pull command is actually a combination of two other commands, git fetch followed by git merge. 
In the first stage of operation git pull will execute a git fetch scoped to the local branch that HEAD is pointed at. 
Once the content is downloaded, git pull will enter a merge workflow. A new merge commit will be-created and HEAD updated to point at the new commit.

Git Merge: git merge origin/master

git fetch and git merge origin/master will fetch & integrate remote changes. Running git merge origin/master without the git fetch is pointless. 
Without a git fetch, your local repository is unaware of any potential changes on the remote repository and origin/master will not have moved.
